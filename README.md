# HACKING.md for Golang

A `HACKING.md` file is a document with technical information that provides guidance for contributors to **understand**, and to **make changes** to a project.

This [HACKING.md](HACKING.md]) file is the `HACKING.md` file I use for _my_ programs (i.e., applications, daemons, etc) that are written using the **Go programming-language** (**Golang**).
(I.e., non-package / non-library Golang code.)
